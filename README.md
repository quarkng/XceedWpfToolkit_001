Experiments with Xceed Extended WPF Toolkit Community Edition

I noticed that the examples in their documentation did not work if you copy/paste them as is.  It appears their documentation is outdated.  By examining their dll files, I have made some of their components work in this program.

### Project Setup Note
You need to install the Xceed Extended WPF Toolkit Community Edition using NuGet.

Tools >> NuGet Package Manager >> Package Manager Console

PM> Install-Package Extended.Wpf.Toolkit
